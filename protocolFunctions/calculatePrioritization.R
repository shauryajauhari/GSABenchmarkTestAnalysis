  ## Owing to the discrepnacies in the calculation of prioritization for different samples (intersections may vary), the resultant list of
  ## lists(results) may have different length components. To ensure fullness of the dataframe we shall calculate the maximum length amongst
  ## all (that should technically be the number of diseases), and structure the shorter lists to fit the dimensions of the dataframe by 
  ## explicit zeros. 
tempList <- list()

for(ind in 1: length(forPrioritization)){tempList <- append(tempList, length(forPrioritization[[ind]]))}
maxNum <- max(unlist(tempList))
forPrioritization <- lapply(forPrioritization, function(x) x[1:maxNum])


forPrioritization <- as.data.frame(forPrioritization) # transform to a dataframe
forPrioritization <- as.data.frame(t(forPrioritization)) # transpose the data frame as the output from the function is a list
row.names(forPrioritization) <- NULL
colnames(forPrioritization) <- diseasePools
forPrioritization$Median <- apply(forPrioritization, 1, median) # median value shall be the basis of plotting the results.
forPrioritization$Samples <- ChIPSeqSamples # add key attribute of sample names. this may be helpful for the purpose of joining dataframes.
forPrioritization[is.na(forPrioritization)] <- 0 ## replacing NAs with zero for lists shorther than the maximum length.
return(forPrioritization)
}

## (For GREAT) Note that in the resultant table, the zero entries reflect that there are no matches between the disease terms and the tool 
## output. While the empty cells mean that the output for the particular sample was not available.
