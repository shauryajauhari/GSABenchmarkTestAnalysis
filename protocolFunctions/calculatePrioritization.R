  ## Owing to the discrepnacies in the calculation of prioritization for different samples (intersections may vary), the resultant list of
  ## lists(results) may have different length components. To ensure fullness of the dataframe we shall calculate the maximum length amongst
  ## all (that should technically be the number of diseases), and structure the shorter lists to fit the dimensions of the dataframe by 
  ## explicit zeros. 

return(forPrioritization)
}

## (For GREAT) Note that in the resultant table, the zero entries reflect that there are no matches between the disease terms and the tool 
## output. While the empty cells mean that the output for the particular sample was not available.
